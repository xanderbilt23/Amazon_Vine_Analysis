## Summary

There could possibly be positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program as over half of the reviews are 5 star reviews and non-Vine reviews only 39% were 5 stars. One additional analysis that could be conducted with the dataset is a summary of the statistics for the star rating for both reviews (mean, median, & mode).
